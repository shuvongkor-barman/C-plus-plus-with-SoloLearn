What is an Object

Object Oriented Programming is a programming style that is intended to make thinking about programming closer to thinking about the real world.

In programming, objects are independent units, and each has its own identity, just as objects in the real world do.
An apple is an object; so is a mug. Each has its unique identity. It's possible to have two mugs that look identical, but they are still separate, unique objects.


Objects

An object might contain other objects but they're still different objects.

Objects also have characteristics that are used to describe them. For example, a car can be red or blue, a mug can be full or empty, and so on. These characteristics are also called attributes. An attribute describes the current state of an object.
Objects can have multiple attributes (the mug can be empty, red and large).
An object's state is independent of its type; a cup might be full of water, another might be empty.


In the real world, each object behaves in its own way. The car moves, the phone rings, and so on.
The same applies to objects - behavior is specific to the object's type.

So, the following three dimensions describe any object in object oriented programming:
 identity, attributes, behavior


In programming, an object is self-contained, with its own identity. It is separate from other objects.
Each object has its own attributes, which describe its current state. Each exhibits its own behavior, which demonstrates what they can do
